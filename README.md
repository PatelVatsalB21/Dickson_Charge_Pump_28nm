## Introduction
The Dickson Charge Pump is a DC-DC converter that produces a higher voltage than the supply voltage. Dickson charge pump removes the need for large inductors by using MOSFETs as switches. Hence making the circuit small in size and energy-efficient. The Dickson Charge Pump is intended for low-voltage purposes. This circuit is widely implemented in various IC applications, especially in non-volatile memories like the Flash and EEPROM and PLLs.
